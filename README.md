# personal-profile
A simple personal profile page, created with HTML and CSS.

Fictional request:

Hello!
I'm looking to create a simple personal profile page for myself. I would like the page to have a clean and pleasant design, using only HTML and CSS. Below are some details of what I'm envisioning:

-- Header:
A header with a dark background (#333) and white text, centered.
The header should contain the title "My Profile".

-- Body:
A container with a maximum width of 800px, centered on the page.
White background with rounded edges (border-radius: 5px) and a soft shadow (box-shadow).
Inner spacing 2em.

-- Profile picture:
A profile picture of me.
The photo should display as a circle.
Width and height of 150px.
Centered horizontally.

-- Personal information:
Just below the profile picture, I would like to display some information.
My name in a bigger font size (24px), bold.
My occupation (eg "Web Developer") in a smaller font size (16px).
My location (eg "My City") in a font size equal to the occupation.

-- General Style:
Use Arial or a similar sans-serif font.
The page background should be a light color (#F4F4F4) for better readability.
Keep even space between elements so the page looks balanced.
